/* THE ONLY SCRIPT the redesign adds. One IIFE: the copy button, and the
   scroll-spy that feeds both networks — the hero MLP and the mini-MLP in the
   bar — plus the outline highlight on the post. No library, and no scroll
   handler: an IntersectionObserver marks the section in view, and the
   CONTRIBUTION FIELD drawn for it is a pure function of its index, so a
   section always draws the same field rather than re-randomising on every
   frame. Hovering or focusing an output unit overrides the spy for as long as
   it lasts; letting go falls back to the section in view. With JS off none of
   this is needed: the markup already carries a graded field with the first
   unit lit, the copy button stays hidden, and no outline item is marked —
   never a wrong one, never a blank box. Transitions are colour and opacity
   only, and CSS suppresses even those under prefers-reduced-motion.

   ONE line differs from the design file, marked JEKYLL below: the mock-up held
   all six views in a single document and switched between them with
   [data-page], so the spy scoped itself to the visible one. Here each view is
   its own route, so it falls back to #main — the same element, reached the way
   a real site reaches it.

   ONE STEP IS ADDED, marked INTEGRATION: step 0, the Markdown pass. The design
   hand-wrote its headings, its outline and its one listing; a real post and a
   real project page arrive as kramdown output instead, so those three pieces
   of furniture have to be hung on the rendered body. It lives here, once, and
   runs over every [data-prose] body on the page — rather than in two inline
   <script> blocks in two layouts, which is where the port first put it. */

 /* === 0. INTEGRATION — THE MARKDOWN PASS ===
    Three jobs the design does in its markup and a rendered Markdown body
    cannot: the spectrogram rule under each h2, the outline built from the
    headings that are actually there, and a .codeblock wrapper round each
    listing so the copy button below has something to bind to. Every one is
    progressive enhancement: with JS off there are no bands, no outline and no
    copy button — never a broken band, never an empty outline box, never a
    dead control.

    The scope is [data-prose], which _layouts/blog_post.html puts on the
    post's .postcontent and _layouts/redesign-project.html on the project's
    article. The outline is built only where the layout has provided a
    .tocwrap for it, so the project page gets rules and listings and no
    outline, which is what it wants.

    .legacy — the kept routes and the talk/teaching detail pages — is listed
    too, but for the LISTINGS ONLY (0c): those pages were decided to get the
    new palette, measures and furniture and no bespoke design, so they take
    the copy button and the un-carded listing and no spectrogram bands. The
    matching CSS in _sass/redesign/_post.scss carries the same two scopes. */

 /* 0. OFF-SITE LINKS OPEN IN A NEW TAB.

    Done here rather than in the includes for two reasons: the links are spread
    across the masthead, the profile column, the award rows, the project rows,
    the footer and the post tail, and — more importantly — the ones inside a
    post's body come from Kramdown rendering his Markdown, where no Liquid can
    reach them. One rule catches every case.

    "Off-site" is decided by comparing the resolved host to this one, so a
    root-relative link, an in-page #anchor and an absolute link that happens to
    point back at the site are all left alone. mailto:, tel: and the like have
    no host and are skipped: they hand off to another application already, and
    opening a blank tab for them leaves a dead window behind.

    rel="noopener noreferrer" goes on with it. Without noopener the opened page
    can reach back through window.opener and navigate this one; it is the one
    genuine security cost of target="_blank".

    A reader without JavaScript simply gets same-tab navigation — the link
    still works, which is why this does not need to be in the markup.

    One pass at load is not quite enough: the mapmyvisitors widget injects its
    own link asynchronously, so it arrives after the pass has run. A debounced
    MutationObserver re-runs the sweep for late arrivals and then gives up
    after fifteen seconds — long enough for any third-party embed, short enough

 /* === 2. THE TWO NETWORKS — THE CONTRIBUTION FIELD (ROUND 6 § 5) ===

    What the design shipped was ONE polyline: input unit, hidden unit, hidden
    unit, output unit, redrawn per section. That is a wire. A network does not
    compute along a wire — every unit of every layer contributes something to
    every output, a few of them a great deal. And because the polyline was the
    only thing that moved, hovering a unit changed nothing: the picture stayed
    on whatever the scroll-spy had last said, which on a freshly loaded page is
    News.

    So: every edge and every node now carries its own weight in [0,1] for the
    ACTIVE output, written as the custom property --w, and the stylesheet
    renders that weight as accent strength — deep oxblood at the top of the
    ramp, pale at the bottom, never zero. The markup already ships one such
    field baked in for output 0, so a reader with no JavaScript sees the same
    instrument, still.

    THE FIELD IS COMPUTED BACKWARDS FROM THE ACTIVE OUTPUT, which is what
    makes it read as a computation rather than as noise:

      relevance of the output layer   1 for the active unit, 0.06 for the rest
      every edge into a unit          that unit's relevance x the edge's own
                                      conductance
      relevance of a unit             0.16 + 0.84 x its strongest onward edge

    so a unit wired strongly into a strongly-relevant unit is itself strongly
    relevant, the effect fades layer by layer back towards the inputs, and
    everything lands in [0,1] with no normalisation pass. Choosing the MAX
    onward edge rather than the sum is what keeps the range bounded and what
    makes the picture a set of paths of differing strength rather than a
    uniform wash.

    DETERMINISTIC, AND NO Math.random ANYWHERE. Every conductance is a hash of
    (active output, depth from the output, source unit, target unit), computed
    with 32-bit integer xorshift only — exact in every engine — so a section
    always draws the same field and re-entering it reproduces it exactly. Each
    field is computed once and cached by topology and index. */
